# Currently worked on major features
* Commands
  * You can open an in-game screen where you can type in commands
  * You can load / unload custom content for the game
* Mods / scripts
  * You will be able to make custom scripts and run them by using the command screen
  * The source code for the game will be public so you can make your own mods
* New tier of enemies
  * After defeating the boss at the top of the map you will progress to a new part of the map with a higher tier
  * This means there are stronger and better enemies, stronger weapons to get and completely new stuff.
